            <p> Spirited Away from Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animated fairy tale film released in 2001. 
                The movie tells the story of Chihiro, a young girl, whose family was moving to a small Japanese town in the countryside. 
                On the way to their new home, her father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. 
                Chihiro's parents decide to feast on a meal they have found set out, and since this ends up being a town inhabited by spirits, demons, and witches, they are punished by the owner of the bathhouse in town, Yubaba, and turned into pigs. 
                As Yubaba is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro, she must rely on Haku, and young boy who tried to warn her of danger, to save her parents in hopes of returning to the human world.

            <p> 
                Kiki's Delivery Service is a coming-of-age story that comes from the beloved Studio Ghibli film makers. 
                Kiki, a teenage witch-in-training, has reached the age of 13. 
                According to tradition, all witches of that age must leave home for one year, so that they can learn how to live on their own. 
                Kiki, along with her talking cat Jiji, fly away to live in the seaside town of Koriko. 
                After starting her own delivery service (using her broom as the delivery vehicle), Kiki must learn how to deal with her new life, especially after she loses the power to fly.
